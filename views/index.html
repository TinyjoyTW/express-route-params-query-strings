<!-- Form data is sent through a GET HTTP request
Form methods can only be GET or POST
The form action is set to /search - when SEARCH button is clicked, the form will make a GET request to the /search route.
Each inputâ€™s attribute name="" gets converted into a key/property on the req.query object. In our case, the req.query will have properties city, startDate, and endDate. The value of the input will be assigned as the corresponding value. -->

<form action="/search" method="GET">
  <label>
    City
    <input type="text" name="city" />
  </label>

  <label>
    Start-Date
    <input type="date" name="startDate" />
  </label>

  <label>
    End-Date

  </label>

  <button type="submit">SEARCH</button>
</form>
